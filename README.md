## Overview
A watchdog which actively looks out for disruption and recovery of critical services. If there is a disruption then it will prevent cascading failure by conservatively scaling down dependent configured resources and if a critical service has just recovered then it will expedite the recovery of dependent services/pods.

Avoiding cascading failure is handled by [Prober](/docs/concepts/prober.md) component and expediting recovery of dependent services/pods is handled by [Weeder](/docs/concepts/weeder.md)  component. These are separately deployed as individual pods.

### Current Limitation & Future Scope
Although in the current offering the `Prober` is tailored to handle one such use case of `kube-apiserver` connectivity, but the usage of prober can be extended to solve similar needs for other scenarios where the components involved might be different.

## Start using or developing the Dependency Watchdog
